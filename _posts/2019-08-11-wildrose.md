Most roses are tamed, claiming only a veneer of beauty. But some are wild and free. And all the more beautiful for it. 

Wild roses wear crowns of thorns.
They are beautiful and dangerous.

Wild roses are hardy, enduring plants.
They are strong and tenacious.

Wild roses are the brightflowers among sprawling tangles of thorns.
They shine bright against the Dark.

Soft petals, strong thorns. Soft heart, strong will. You are my wild rose.
