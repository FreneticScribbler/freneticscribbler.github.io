It has been more than a few months since I last abandoned this site. Now here I am finally back to it. And all it took was a global bloody pandemic! My particular thoughts on that are liable to come later.

This is just a heartbeat to show that I'm back, not that I ever truly left. I'm hoping to break the cycle of frenzied intrest then drifting away that I fall into with so many things. I have no idea what this blog will be, as always, but I am at least hoping to return to fiction writing. As for the rest of the site, expect it to be gradually themed to my liking and turned into something of a portfolio - I might have finally figured out what I want to do with my life, and it definetely depends on a strong *personal brand* much as I hate that buzzword.

But I said that last time, didn't I? :)

Immediately next up is moving this site to somewhere hosted on my own infrastructure, the construction of which is one of the many things that has been keeping be busy in these crazy times, in the sudden absence of my 'day job'. Then I've gotta get all my old content moved over (which will probably involve spending longer hacking together a bash script than manually converting the posts would have taken me) before I can get to work making new shinies. There's also a suprising amount of non-digital stuff I need to talk about.

That's not all, folks. But bye for now.
