I am...

## Short Answer

Frenetic

***

## Long Answer

Frenetic. I like that word. Not entirely positive, but not entirely negative either. Definetely implying chaos - something I wield to *get things done*. That...actually, is a pretty good summary of how I do. Not what I do, but how I do it - chaotic process with undeniable results. Or something like that.

I've always found the question of what I do and who I am a difficult one because the answer is at once so simple and so complicated. I do so many things. I write - both prose and code. I make, both digital and physical. I am an occasional philospher. But maybe all those things aren't as different as they seem every day - there's a common thread of creativity (chaos) running throug them all. I am a Maker in the broadest, most DIY/Hacker sense of the term and damn proud of it I am too.
